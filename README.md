# lem-in

an exercice from 42 school

the mandatory part quite often finds the shortest way of getting ants out, as long as there are not too many rooms linked by too many tunnels.

the optional part ( 'visu-hex' ) ain't neither nice nore respectful of the 42 norm. I hope it works even if SDL isn't installed.
